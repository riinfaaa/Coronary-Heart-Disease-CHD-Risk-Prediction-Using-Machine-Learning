# ü´ÄCoronary-Heart-Disease-CHD-Risk-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project leverages supervised machine learning algorithms (primarily Decision Trees) to classify patients as high-risk or low-risk for CHD, based on anonymized clinical features.
---
## üöÄ Project Overview

Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early and accurate identification of individuals at risk is critical for proactive clinical intervention.This repository contains a complete end-to-end workflow for predicting the likelihood of coronary heart disease (CHD) using clinical and demographic data, built with Colab notebooks. 

End-to-end workflow: From importing and exploring raw data to building, evaluating, and interpreting predictive models.

Clean, robust, and reproducible: All code written for clarity and education, ideal for both practitioners and learners.

Real-world impact: Gain insights into the most predictive clinical markers for CHD.
